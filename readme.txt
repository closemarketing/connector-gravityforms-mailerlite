This plugin connects GravityForms with MailerLite.

== Description ==
[GravityForms](https://close.marketing/go/gravityforms/) plugin gives you the posibility to create forms in a very simple way. It has a lot of addons that connects GravityForms with online services, but [MailerLite](https://close.marketing/go/mailerlite/) is not in that list.

[We are experts in Mailerlite!](https://www.mailerlite.com/experts/closemarketing)

Only with your API Key from MailerLite you will connect every form to MailerLite, in order to keep all your subscribers in MailerLite. 

Steps: 
- Go GravityForms > Settings > MailerLite. Put your MailerLite API Key that is in integrations tab.
- Once the API is valid, you will have to go to every form that needs to connect to MailerLite.
- In every Form > MailerLite > Create new feed. You will have to map every form field to MailerLite fields.

That's all! Every user that fills that form, It will upload lead to MailerLite.
